= An approximation for the reflectance from a semi-infinite medium

I introduce a simple analytical approximation for the reflectance from a
semi-infinite medium which has scattering and absorption. Its inverse
transformation (reflectance to scattering/absorption coefficients) has also
simple analytical solution.

See link:build/transfer.pdf[build/transfer.pdf] (currently written only in
Japanese).

Although this work is original, it is obvious that similar works exist (...and
they are most likely better than mine) since it seems a very basic and common
problem.  Unfortunately I cannot find them, at least freely avaiable on the
Web.  Let me know if you find them and I should cite them.

== TL; DR

----
ks : Scattering coefficient
ka : Absorption coefficient
 k : Attenuation (= ks + ka)
 R : Reflectance
 γ = 1.4

ks, ka => R
    P = sqrt(ka / (ks + ka))
    R = (1 - P) / (1 + γ * P)

R, k => ks, ka
    ka = k * ((1 - R) / (1 + γ * R)) ^ 2
    ks = 1 - ka
