= An approximation for reflectance from semi-infinite medium

The simple analytical approximation for reflectance from semi-infinite medium
which have a scattering and absorption. Its inverse transformation (reflectance
to scattering/absorption coefficients) has also simple analytical solution.

See link:build/transfer.pdf[build/transfer.pdf] (currently written only in
Japanese).

== TL; DR

----
ks : Scattering coefficient
ka : Absorption coefficient
 k : Attenuation (= ks + ka)
 R : Reflectance
 γ = 1.4

ks, ka => R
    P = sqrt(ka / (ks + ka))
    R = (1 - P) / (1 + γ * P)

R, k => ks, ka
    ka = k * ((1 - R) / (1 + γ * R)) ^ 2
    ks = 1 - ka
